Conceptualizing a Project

1. Establish a purpose (thesis, subject matter => why do we have this subject matter and what can we do with it?)

2. Figure out how to display this thesis
    - What do we want to say? What is our angle?
    - How have other said this? What is their angle?
    - Visual language for this thesis?

3. Do the work
    - Includes a refinement step. Where can we make improvements?
